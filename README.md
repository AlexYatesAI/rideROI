# Transportation & Viral Suppression ROI Pilot (`rideROI`)

**Author:** [AlexYatesAI](https://github.com/AlexYatesAI) 
**Type:** Program Evaluation (Synthetic Data Demonstration) 
**Tags:** HIV Care, Transportation Assistance, Viral Suppression, ROI, HRSA Best Practices 

---

## Overview

This project models how **ride assistance (vouchers)** can improve appointment adherence and viral load suppression (VLS) among people living with HIV. 
It is designed as a **portfolio case study**, using **synthetic data only**, and follows the style of HRSA Ryan White Program best practice write-ups. 

---

## Objectives
1. Evaluate whether ride assistance improves appointment adherence. 
2. Assess impact on viral suppression outcomes. 
3. Estimate **return on investment (ROI)** by comparing ride costs with avoided hospitalizations.

## Stakeholders & Alignment
Effective program management requires cross-functional collaboration. This pilot reflects how transportation support aligns multiple perspectives: 

- **Patients** → fewer barriers to care, improved dignity, greater trust. 
- **Frontline Staff** → reduced no-show follow-up, smoother engagement. 
- **Finance Teams** → clear ROI demonstrating cost savings. 
- **Leadership** → stronger viral suppression rates supporting HRSA goals. 
- **Funders/Policy Makers** → scalable, evidence-based intervention.

## Deliverables
- **Data:** `/data/` synthetic CSVs 
- **Analysis:** `/notebooks/` Jupyter notebooks (Python, charts, metrics) 
- **Dashboard:** `/dashboard/rideROI.pbix` (Power BI) 
- **Reports:** `/reports/` evaluation brief & slides (leadership-ready) 
- **Docs:** `/docs/` HRSA references, notes, program charter

## Executive Implications
- **Financial Impact:** Every $1 invested in ride vouchers may yield multiple dollars in avoided ER visits and hospitalizations. 
- **Operational Efficiency:** Ride support reduces missed appointments, freeing staff resources for higher-value work. 
- **Strategic Alignment:** Transportation interventions directly advance HRSA’s viral suppression and retention performance measures. 
- **Scalability:** The framework can be replicated across clinics or adapted for state-level implementation.
